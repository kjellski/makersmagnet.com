Heyy Everyone, Makers and DIYers,

Due to a the COVID-19 pandemic there aren't many possibilities to meet in person right now. That's a shame and we tried to come up with a solution to make makers meet in a way that is as close to meeting in real live as possible. I don't know if that was already attempted, but I'd like to announce our try to establish a public Discord Server for our maker community. We've currently set the Discord Server up to be publicly available and would love to make it as accessible as possible. Discord is an app you can download and install for free on your mobile or PC/Mac in order to participate in a voice chat. We'd be able to talk to each other - what do you think?
